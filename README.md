## A very simple js app starter

Should be good for a starter for simple js apps and quickly creating test cases.
I'm including the indium lib for emacs support.

We are using esbuild for building the bundle.
 
## Use

Clone the repo. 
Then change the directory name and any other strings you might want to.
Running 'npm install' will install the modules.
